Maps
Maps are unordered collection of key value pairs.  They can also be referred to
as associative arrays, hash tables, or dictionaries.  Maps are used to look up
a value by its associated key.  

Maps must be initialized BEFORE they can be used.

Maps look similar to arrays but with a few key differences.  the length of a map
is not fixed and it can change as we add items to it.  Upon initial creation,
it has a length of 0; after the first item is added to it, it has a length of 1.
Just because the map now has an item in it; it does not indicate that there is a
0 element as well.
